# ConfPal

ConfPal is a social networking platform that helps conference attendees connect more meaningfully — before, during, and after events.

## 🚀 Overview

ConfPal was inspired by a real academic conference experience (shoutout to CHI 2025), where a WeChat group of 260+ Chinese attendees organically became the hub for sharing session takeaways, local tips, and arranging casual meetups. Despite its energy, the experience was unstructured, hard to navigate, and only reachable by a limited group of attendees.

At the same time, I noticed another common pain point: badges only show names and affiliations, but don't communicate what we work on, what we’re looking for, or what kind of collaboration we’re open to. Every attendee needs a simple, powerful digital profile — a "conference identity" at a glance.

ConfPal brings these two insights together.

## ✨ Features

- **Personalized Digital Profiles**  
  Showcase your research interests, background, and links — all in one  profile card.

- **Conference Update Feed**  
  Share relevant updates and session links to foster a more informative and collaborative community.

- **Connection & Discovery Tools**  
  Explore public posts, discover attendees with similar interests, and connect beyond the badge.
